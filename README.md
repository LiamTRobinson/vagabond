## Approach Taken

Each morning, we met as a team to whiteboard the tasks of each sprint that we'd be tackling, and divided up the work according to which tasks would have the lowest likelihood of interfering/causing git conflicts. From there, we assigned out responsibilities and worked in either a pair programming or individual approach. Once we finished the base requirements of a sprint, team members would brainstorm additional above-and-beyond features to include, and would then work on branches to try to add the features. Once we reached a good stopping point, we would then sit together as a group and merge all branches to master, talking through any conflicts in real time. This allowed us to work quickly and efficiently, and accomplish many additional features without running into crippling git conflicts.


## Future goals / unsolved features:

* Integrate Angular for the frontend
* Include dynamic map on homepage with city markers (Google Maps API)
* Ability for users to upvote comments (Reddit-style)
* Incorporate social sign-in and integration
* Ability to connect with other users in groups based on interests
